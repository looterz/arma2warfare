BombaS Changelog:

Basically this modification tries to balance BLUEFOR and OPFOR with the drawback on technical/historical accuracy.
All the below options get activated by "weapon balance" parameter.

Reason 1: I did not want to change default models. 
Reason 2: The modification should work without any addons.
Reason 3: Make game more irregular
Reason 4: Shift priorities to capture cities, not attack enemy bases

BombaS,

- More carefull placement items from constuction menu. Now impossible build something inside another building. But can build near with minimal distance.
- Commander can ability to sell and buy supplies in central depot of any captured town. Exchange rate demand from how much supplies get a town.
- Commander can build base in a town.
- Artillery: Player notified when target out of range or how much arty guns can hit target;
- Players can build static defences around town, without repair truck. Static defences cost was decreased to 4 times
- Players can buy heavy vehicles, light vehicles and solidiers in central depot of any captured city (while factories are alive). Price increased to x3.
- Upgradable extra factory protection. Demand from barracks upgrade level:
	Lvl 0 and 1:  default factory protection (can be destroyed from ~1-2 SMAW shells)
	Lvl 2: protection up to x3 (can be destroyed from ~3-4 SMAW shells)
	Lvl 3: protection up to x5 (can be destroyed from ~5-6 SMAW shells)
- After 10 minutes from last attack factory start autorepair. Autorepair required from 0 to 20 minutes, which demand how much factory was damaged. Repaired factory has 100% health.

BombaS
