BombaS Changelog:

Basically this modification tries to balance BLUEFOR and OPFOR with the drawback on technical/historical accuracy.
All the below options get activated by "weapon balance" parameter.

Reason 1: I did not want to change default models. 
Reason 2: The modification should work without any addons.
Reason 3: Make game more irregular
Reason 4: Shift priorities to capture cities, not attack enemy bases

BombaS,

- Added ability to sell and buy supplies in central depot of any captured cities
- The possibility to build a static defences in the town for any player
- Increase factories strength to x5 (Saboteurs cant now destroy all base with use 5 SMAW shells, 5 SMAW for one builing is required)
- Buy tanks, light, and solidirs in central depot of any captured cities

Regards,
BombaS
