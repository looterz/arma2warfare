BombaS Changelog:

Basically this modification tries to balance BLUEFOR and OPFOR with the drawback on technical/historical accuracy.
All the below options get activated by "weapon balance" parameter.

Reason 1: I did not want to change default models. Reason 2: The modification should work without any addons.

BombaS1

- T55 and T72 feature barrel launched ATGM > Counterpart for US tanks
- ZSU features 8 IGLA > Counterpart for Avenger

- Mi24 D features R73 AA missiles instead of AT > No specific counterpart 
- Mi24 V features 12 AT9 ATAKA ATGM > No specific counterpart; more of these bad missiles at least do a little damage
- Ka52 features 8 Hellfire > Counterpart for AH64
- Ka52 BLACK features 8 Hellfires and 2 R73 AA missiles > Counterpart for AH1z
- MH6 features Laser designator > wanted it, did it. Transforms it into a kind of observation helicopter.

ZGMv3:

- Implemented BAF rifles from 1.54 patch to OPFOR side
- Static TOW usable again
- US-ambulance on light factory LVL 1

ZGMv4:

- Changed "KAMOV" parameter to "Artillery Vehicles". Until Benny fixes the arty system, all artillery vehicles can be disabled by this parameter due to a serious exploit.
